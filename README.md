# Automated Email Responder for Collaboration Requests

## Overview

This project presents an Automated Email Responder script, tailored for professionals like Max Grabel, a DJ and Music Creator. It streamlines the process of responding to collaboration requests by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze incoming emails and automatically generating personalized replies based on predefined profiles and rate cards.

## Features

- **NLP Analysis**: Breaks down incoming emails to understand context and intent using spaCy.
- **Personalized Responses**: Crafts responses based on the analysis, reflecting individual preferences and professional rates.
- **Customizable Profiles**: Offers flexibility to modify user profiles and response templates to better align with personal branding and response strategies.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before setting up the project:
- Python 3.8 or newer.
- spaCy library, for NLP functions.
- TextBlob library, for sentiment analysis and additional NLP features.
- Access to a Gmail account for integration (optional for automation).

### Installation

To set up the script on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install spacy textblob google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```
    or Mac

   ```bash
    pip3 install spacy textblob google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```

4. Download the spaCy English core model:

    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

5. (Optional) Set up Gmail API by following Google's Gmail API Python Quickstart guide.

## Usage

1. Update the `max_profile` dictionary in the script with your information, preferences, and rates.
2. Run the script. It can monitor incoming emails in real-time or process a predefined set of emails for demonstration purposes.
3. Customize the email response templates and conditions within the script as needed to accommodate different types of collaboration queries and offers.

## Enhancements in the Latest Version

- **Enhanced Email Confirmation**: Post email dispatch, the script now prints a confirmation including recipient, subject, and body for user validation.
- **Improved NLP Processing**: Updated logic for more accurate context and sentiment analysis.
- **Automated Email Integration**: Extended documentation for easier setup and integration with Gmail API for automated processing.

## Development Considerations

The script focuses on:
- **Seamless Automation**: Integration with email APIs for automated email processing.
- **Detailed Personalization**: Responses that accurately reflect user-specific details and professional guidelines.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Improved NLP for better understanding and categorization of email content.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reducing response time while maintaining high communication standards.

## Challenges and Resolutions

- **NLP Adaptability**: Enhanced the model and refined algorithms for broader email context comprehension.
- **Response Applicability**: Expanded user profile settings and response conditions for greater relevancy.
- **Integration Simplicity**: Provided clearer setup instructions and streamlined Gmail API integration process.
